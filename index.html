              </h2>
              <p class="intro">I'm a high school graduate who is excited to pursue computer science and explore the emerging fields of AI and 
                data science. I am fortunate to receive offers from some of the best universities in the world and am ready to 
                go anywhere god takes me. I'm sure there's a lot to explore and everything will happen for good. I'm currently
                learning web development and hope to learn it well. </p>

                <h3>Cricket</h3>
                <p>Cricket has been the love of my life since my childhood and I guess it is in the blood of our Indians. It was a great pastime for me to 
                    enjoy playing cricket with my friends, especially at school. I get nostalgia everytime I speak about it!

                <h3>Tennis</h3>
                <p>I was introduced to this sport only in 2017 when I changed my school. Surprisingly, I started picking up this sport very quickly
                    despite having absolutely no experience in this. I have also won district level competition and advanced to state level tennis twice.
